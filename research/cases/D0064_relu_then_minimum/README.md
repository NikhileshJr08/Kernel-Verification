# ReLU then minimum

Evidence: `numerical_pass_then_adversarial_failure`. Contract: `ieee_special_values`.

relu/min fused kernel; audit reports a NaN-mask disagreement.

Published adversarial testing result, not an SMT proof or a documented production incident. Final and best round are both 5, avoiding a last-vs-best extraction ambiguity. Upstream ID join supplies the pass/fail provenance; locally extracted candidate hashes are recorded, but the audit does not publish per-row candidate hashes.

Reference: `reference.py`. Candidate: `candidate.py`.
